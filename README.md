# DiceSum

DiceSum is a game that my partners and I developed during Cornerstone Engineering for our final project. 
The theme of the game was suppossed to be Casino Night.
So, we ultimately chose a simple game with a little twist to it. 
It was almost like a slot machine but the player has to guess what the sum of the dice would be. 
They would have to guess if the given number was higher or lower than the actual dice values.
I mostly programmed for my team while the others worked on the electrical side of the Arduino.
We used both Arduino and Processing to display the game onto a different monitor instead of using the small LCD monitor.
Processing is used for visual arts and design. They have a library built for the Arduino and therefore can be used alongside it.
